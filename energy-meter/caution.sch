Mains voltage is dangerous!\nIf you don't know the relevant standards or don't\nhave any practical experience, stay away from it!\n\nThis project has not been designed by a professional.\nIt might have major flaws that we are not aware of.\nDo your own review and don't assume that this is safe.\nIf you do find any potential flaws, please tell us!\n\nIf you build this as a competent hobbyist, remove any\nmarks of certification (e.g. from repurposed cables) and\nmake sure that potential users are aware of the dangers.\n\nYou must not build or use this project/design unless\n- you have the skills, training and practical experience\n  to do a proper review\n- and you have done said review and are confident that it is safe\n  (the design as well as your implementation)\n- and you take full responsibility for any dangers and damages.\n(Consider this part of the license so you are actually not\n allowed to use this unless you comply to these terms.)

Here are some hints to get you started with your review:\n- The secondary side is SELV to avoid any ground offset\n  to whatever is talking to the MCU. It will become PELV\n  in many cases, e.g. when connected to a stationary\n  computer. Thus, the design must comply to all requirements\n  for SELV as well as PELV.\n- We need reinforced isolation (or double isolation):\n  - 3mm air gap and creeping distance to L/N/PE.\n  - Only 1.5mm air gap and creeping distance between L/N/PE\n    because that doesn't have to be reinforced isolation.\n  - Distance through FR4 must be at least 0.4mm so a 1.6mm\n    board is more than enough.\n  - Distance between L_IN/OUT/OUT2 is not so critical because\n    it would only turn on a path that can exist in normal application.\n    The same goes between the SSR pins (primary side only, of course).\n  - This is for below 2 km, relative humidity of less than 95%, non\n    condensing and pollution degree 2. Make sure that any potential\n    users know these limitations.\n  - Transformer and relay have to be rated for reinforced isolation.\n  - The current transformer only has basic isolation. Unless your\n    wire meets the criteria for additional isolation, you have to add\n    some isolation, e.g. some of these may be suitable:\n    https://www.tme.eu/de/katalog/elektro-isolationshullen_113546/\n  - It may be a good idea to use a solid (single stranded) wire, glue it\n    down and add some isolation to the low voltage side of the SSRs.\n    That way, it won't do any harm if the solder joints ever come loose.\n  - You may have to add one or two layers of isolation to other wires\n    below/above the PCB, as well. If you remove the sheath or you don't\n    have any isolation ratings or they are only 2kV between the wires, this\n    is most likely not enough for basic or additional isolation. In that case,\n    you need two layers of isolation. In any case, make sure that the outer\n    layer of isolation cannot be punctured by \n- The PE on the board isn't required for safety and cannot be because M3\n  with 0.5 Nm wouldn't be enough for that. The PE to the device under\n  test *is* required so we cannot use the screw terminal to connect it.\n  - Our best idea is using Wago 221-413. We are not sure whether this is\n    allowed but it is used for similar purposes in CAT-III applications\n    (in "Unterputzdosen" - junction boxes).\n  - The screw terminal should be enough\n- Use proper strain relief.\n  - The enclosure doesn't have any cable clamps - only bend protectors.\n  - The bend protectors sit quite tight and a cable tie can be used to ensure\n    that the cable cannot be pulled out. This is probably not compliant\n    with the relevant standards.\n  - Alternatives are to be determined.\n- The enclosure doesn't come with screws for the PCB. Make sure they\n  have the proper size (not too long, head not too large).\n- We assume that upstream of our input there is a fuse for at most 16A.\n  - Any part of this device should be able to handle 16A well enough that\n    we don't need a fuse inside the device.\n  - The relay can handle 16 A but only for resistive loads. There is a good\n    chance that it won't survive certain loads. This shouldn't be a safety\n    issue but it can be inconvenient.\n  - 16A at 60°C needs 275 mil^2 of copper. This means 0.2'' width for 1 oz\n    copper. We use the bottom and top layer so this  is 0.1'' = 2.54 mm on\n    each layer. The thermal spokes are 0.8 mm so we need at least 4 of them\n    (2 per layer) for each pad.\n  - N is smaller because current on the PCB can never be 16A. We have\n    to keep the 1.5 mm distance around the resistors to actually ensure that.

Checklist for assembly:\n- PE should be longer\n- Additional isolation for all wires\n- Protect SSRs from wire through\n  current transformer.\n- Strain relief\n- Add proper documentation and\n  warnings on enclosure

What to tell users:\n- not a professional product - review before use\n- environmental conditions (16A fuse, <2km, 95% rho)\n- 16A !resistive! max load\n  - Many loads are not resistive and max current can\n    be significantly lower for them.\n- relay only disconnects one pole so DUT may have\n  dangerous voltages even if turned off\n- max. 50°C ambient temperature
